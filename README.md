**Overview**
For this assignment, you will need to submit both the code that you have produced for your project to date and written responses to the report prompts in the ‘My Assignment’ tab. 

# The aim of this assignment is to make sure that your project meets the requirements for the main submission at the end of the module and that you have made sufficient progress so far. The assessment of your project will also be based on your use of design and planning techniques and the quality of your writing.

The report prompts in the ‘My Assignment’ tab allow you to include images, headings and text formatting. Make sure you use the features to highlight your points clearly. 

# You must not write more than the stated word limit for each prompt or you will lose marks (10% discretion will be applied, so for a 400 word limit, 440 words or less will not be penalised). You can write fewer words without any penalty.

It is acceptable to use bullet points to briefly explain your project; for example, the extensions you are adding to the template. However, you should also include the coding techniques you will use and how complex you believe the extension to be.

# Don’t worry about your code being a work in progress; we are not looking at the code's stability or quality in this assignment. However, we want to see evidence that you are making progress and have considered you initial implementation ideas practically.


**Review Criteria**
In general we will be marking and commenting on the following criteria:

1. Is your project sufficiently complex enough to meet the criteria of the assignment? - *20%*

# This will be important in determining if you need to add additional extensions or revise them to use more coding techniques. The marker will indicate in the comments if they think you are taking too much on and should maybe reduce the scope of the project. 

2. Have you made satisfactory progress on the project so far? - *30%* 

# Use this as a guide for how you have progressed so far and what you still need to achieve. A low score here will indicate that you are in danger of not completing the project in time or with sufficient difficulty.

3. Have you provided a detailed enough plan of how you are going to complete your project? - *20%*

4. Does the design work you have produced (notes, interface designs, code design drawings) effectively detail the development process you have undertaken? - *15%*

5. Has your report been well enough written and accurately communicates your work at the required level of detail? This includes spelling and grammar. - *15%*
